Gesha coffee is renowned for its exquisite taste, characterized by floral and tea-like notes. It offers a delicate and complex aroma with hints of jasmine, bergamot, and tropical fruits. The flavor profile is often described as vibrant, clean, and remarkably smooth, with a well-balanced acidity. The coffee's distinct qualities are attributed to the specific terroir of the Gesha region, including the altitude, soil composition, and climate, which contribute to the development of its exceptional flavor profile.

The popularity of Gesha coffee can be traced back to its discovery and subsequent cultivation in Panama's Boquete region. In 2004, a coffee producer named Hacienda La Esmeralda introduced Gesha coffee to the specialty coffee market, stunning coffee enthusiasts and experts with its unparalleled taste. Since then, Gesha coffee has become synonymous with luxury and has been consistently recognized as one of the world's finest coffees.
